Golden Circles

Golden circles on the griddle dance,
Bubbles rising in a sweet romance,
Butter melting, syrup flowing free,
Morning magic, breakfast poetry.

Fluffy stacks piled high with care,
Warm and tender, light as air,
Maple ribbons cascade down,
The finest treasure to be found.

Flip them once when edges dry,
Watch them sizzle, hear them sigh,
Perfect rounds of golden brown,
The best breakfast in any town.

With berries blue or bananas sweet,
Powdered sugar, such a treat,
Each bite a moment of delight,
Pancakes make the morning bright.

So raise your fork without delay,
Celebrate this perfect day,
For pancakes are more than they seem—
They're edible sunshine, a breakfast dream.
